Work I did for a nonprofit, Let's Get Ready

Includes VBA I wrote for a basic excel macro which generates score reports for students taking the SAT. Nothing enterprise level right now, just a hack I wrote up to make grading easier and help my students. It made it easier for me to help a student if I was aware that they got 30% of geometry questions correct and 100% of the algebra questions correct.
